# Done but needs work/balancing
- Saiyan trait

- Saiyan culture


# Ideas to implement

- Event to find a Saiyan child
    - Child has Saiyan trait but adopted culture/language

- Event to spawn saiyans from space
    - Need a Saiyan culture
    - Possibly need a Saiyan language

- Martial Arts lifestyle
    - Try to avoid naming branches after schools like the Kame school
    - Need to avoid making bonuses too good to prevent a world full of superhumans
    - Branches
        - Mysticism
            - Ki focused (Learning + Prowess)
            - Final trait should give long life span (like Roshi)
        - Combat
            - Martial + Prowess focused
            - Give trait that lets character train
        - Assassination
            - Intrigue + Prowess focused
            - Get ideas from General Tao, Freeza, etc

- Half-saiyan blood
    - Anbennar devs seem to have solution for mixed blood traits
    - Naruto mod has a solution for mix blood traits too

- Alien trait with opinion malus
    - Adopted Saiyans instead have a secret


# Long term ideas

- Martial Arts tournument

- Dragon ball artifacts that can summon Shenron to grant a wish
    - Probably easier to avoid making the artifacts specific starred dragonballs (not sure how to deal with duplicates)
        - Maybe need to look at Excalibur in CK3 files

- Giving Saiyans an actual tail

- Other races from Dragonball Universe

- Super Saiyans
    - Very rare legendary super saiyan with special base trait
        - Consider having decendants of the LSS having a special version of Saiyan trait or another trait
